# Penguin Image Classification Project

![pg.jpeg](https://qiita-image-store.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/0/3292052/b8d47109-468c-8f34-7ded-7db488a687d4.jpeg)

This project focuses on the classification of penguin images into 7 distinct categories, including 6 different penguin genera and a non-penguin class.

The primary objective is to develop and deploy a web application that allows users to interactively explore the model's predictions.

## Project Overview

The project involves training a deep learning model to classify images of penguins into predefined categories.

This goal is to create a user-friendly web application that showcases the model's capabilities in predicting the species of penguins present in the provided images.

## Demo Page

The website for this project is also available at the following [Penguin Demo](https://kagami-tsukimura.github.io/penguin-image-classification/)

However, due to server issues, the site may be slow to load, especially on the first launch.
It is recommended to use the site locally for serious use.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Image Classification Techniques:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Semantic Segmentation (if needed)
