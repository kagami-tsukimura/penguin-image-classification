# Penguin Image Classification Project

This project focuses on the classification of penguin images into 7 distinct categories, including 6 different penguin genera and a non-penguin class. The primary objective is to develop and deploy a web application that allows users to interactively explore the model's predictions.

## Project Overview

The project involves training a deep learning model to classify images of penguins into predefined categories. The ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly web application that showcases the model's capabilities in predicting the species of penguins present in the provided images.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Image Classification Techniques:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Semantic Segmentation (if needed)
